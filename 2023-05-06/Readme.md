# Modules:

- A module represents a group of classes, methods, functions and variables

- While we are developing software, there may be several classes, methods and functions.

- We should first group them depending on their relationship into various modules and later use this modules in the other programs

- Once the module is created we can reuse it in any program that needs that module

- In python there are several in built modules like sys, io, time, etc...

- Just like these modules, we can also create our own modules and use them whenever we need them
