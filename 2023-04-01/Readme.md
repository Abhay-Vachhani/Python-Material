# Break and Continue:

## Break statement:
- The break statement in Python works as a loop control statement.

- It can be used inside a for loop, while loop or nested loop to come out of the loop

- When break statement is executed the python interpreter jumps out of the loop to process the next statement

- Break statement is used to bring the control out of the loop

- When some external condition is triggered

- It terminates the current loop

- That is (i.e.) the loop in which it appears, and resumes execution at the next statement immediately after the end of that loop

- If the break statement inside a nested loop, the break will terminate the inner most loop
