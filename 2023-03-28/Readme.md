## Lab (Lecture)

# For loop:
- It can be used to execute a group of statements repeatedly depending upon the number of elements in the sequence.

- <u>The for loop can work with sequence like string, list, tuple, range, etc...</u>

- Syntax:
```python
    for var sequence:
        statements
```

- The first element of the sequence is assigned to the variable written after 'for' and then the statements are executed next second element of the sequence is assigned to the variable and the statements are executed second time

- In this way, for each element of the sequence, the statements are executed

- So the for loop is executed as many times as there are number of elements in the sequence

- Example:

```python
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
```
