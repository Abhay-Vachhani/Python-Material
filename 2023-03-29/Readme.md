# Nested loops:

- Note: Outer loop is incharge of rows and inner loop is incharge of columns

- Nested loop mean loop inside a loop.

- In python programming language there are two types of loops
    1) while loop
    2) For loop

- Using these loop we can create nested loops

- For example while loop inside for loop, for loop inside for loop, etc

- The inner loop will be executed one time for each iteration of the outer loop
