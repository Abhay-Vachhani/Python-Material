# Operators:

### 5) Logical Operators:
- Logical operators are useful to construct compound conditions
- A compound condition is a combination of more than one simple condition.
- Each of the simple condition is evaluated to True or False and then the decision is taken to know wether the total condition is True or False
- In case of logical operators False indicates 0 and True indicates any other number

a = 100
b = 200

| Sr No | Operator | Example | Meaning | Result |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1) | and | a and b | If a is False, it returns a, otherwise it returns b. | 200 |
|2) | or | a or b | If a is False, it returns b, otherwise it returns a. | 100 |
|3) | not | not a | If a is False, it returns True, otherwise False. | False |

### 6) Boolean Operators:
- The result provided by boolean operators will either True or False
