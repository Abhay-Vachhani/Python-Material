# Operators:
- An operator is a symbol that performs an operation
- An operator acts on some variables which are known as operands
- We can classify the operators depending upon their nature as below:
    - Arithmetic Operator
    - Assignment Operator
    - Unary minus Operator
    - Relational Operator
    - Logical Operator
    - Boolean Operator
    - Bitwise Operator
    - Membership Operator
    - Identity Operator

### 1) Arithmetic Operators:
- This type of operators are used to perform simple arithmetic operations

<!-- Sr No. | Operator | Meaning | -->
<!-- |:-|:-|:-| -->
<!-- 1 | + | Addition operator. Adds two values -->
<!-- 2 | - | Subtraction operator. Subtracts one value from another -->
<!-- 3 | * | Multiplication operator. Multiplies two values  -->
<!-- 4 | / | Division operator. Divides left operand by the right operand -->
<!-- 5 | % | Modulus operator. Calculates -->

### 2) Assignment Operators:
- Generally, this type of operators are used to store the right side value to the left side variable we can also use this operators to perform some simple arithmetic operations and to store it to the variable
- It is possible to assign the same value to two variables
```python
    a = b = 16
    print(a, b)
```

- It is also possible to assign different values to two variables
```python
    a, b = 16, 7
    print(a, b)
```

### 3) Unary Minus Operator:
- The unary minus operator is denoted by minus ( - ), When the operator is used before a variable by doing so the value of variable is negated
- It means if the value of variable is positive then it will converted to negative and if its value is negative then it will converted to positive
```python
    a = 7
    print(-a) # -7

    a = -7
    print(-a) # 7
```

### 4) Relational Operators:
- Relational operators are used to compare two values or variables, wether values in both variables are same or which one is bigger or which one is lesser
- These operators give result into True or False
