# While loop:
- A normal statement is executed top to bottom only once.

- But we can use while loop to execute certain block of statements number of times depending on whether condition becomes True or False

- Syntax:
```python
    while condition:
        statements
```

- Here statements represents one statements or block of statements

- An interpreter first check the condition if the condition is True, then it will execute the statement written after the colon (:)

- After executing statements it will go again to check condition

- If the condition is found True, it will execute the statements

- This process will be repeated as many times the condition becomes True

- As soon as the condition becomes False, the interpreter will come out of the while loop
